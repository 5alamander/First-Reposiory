System
-	exist logic
	----	the "clear & update" logic, may use "fresh" instead
		[player, gameScene, card]
		it may be a bad way to implement this, `keep it simple and stupid`
	
----	buffs
	-----	the class type
	--	the basic buffs
	---	some special buffs
	--	when add, use the owner to find the gs
		bind buffs' effect on gs when add
----	buff-gback
	new buff {atk:1, hp:2}, lifeTime = 1 [or -1 means never disappear]
	buff silence: onAdd, to trigger all exist buff down

+!----	trigger
	bind(waiter, 'trigger name') 
	if trigger('addBuff', source, this, buff)#`us broadcast`
		# do something
	else
		# other thing

	+!----	change the old triggers
		gs.listen(t, 'onUse')
		gs.broadcast('onUse', a)
		the triggers all use 'when-'

	.-	(may done)to create trigger automatically

	+----	change Card constructor, by the way, orgnize the when-trigger
		use {}

--	Hero class
	--	hero skills
	--	type?

---	die list

--	net work

--	input system
	2 state
		wait instruction
		0, 0, 0 to end a turn
		x1, x1, to indicate no aim

		wait self turn
	to simulate
		use (player, source, aim[, selection])

	!-- 	recheck the conditions

---	activate when out of the collectionList
	---	means, use the add tag in gameScene

GB design
	----	player Action, use(source, aim, selection), selection is for choice card
	--	a class for selection, just as the card


for test
	--	default card collections to init a gameScene in a moment
	--	defualt 1: 30 'default' cards
	--	defualt 2: 15 'default servant' and 15 'default magic'
